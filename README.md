# SeqAndDestroy
A bubble-shooter game where the ammunition are siRNA sequences fighting off the incoming HIV sequences. <br />
Both sequences must align in order to destroy the HIV groups. <br />
The substitution rate can be manipulated as a difficulty setting. <br />
You can also simulate rapid mutation of the HIV virus using [SpartaABC webserver!](http://spartaabc.tau.ac.il/webserver/) <br />
